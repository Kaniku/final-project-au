# About This Project

Nowadays, people are commonly using taxis as their transportations But, the company face some problem like there are so many people who need a taxi at workday and fewer people who need a taxi when itâ€™s not
workday So, through this model, we try to predict the passenger hotspot using DNN In this project, we take the dataset from Aidea After that, we preprocess the data and then set the hyperparameter for the model The
target from this case is Hire_count Using the test data, we try to predict using the model From this model, we will increase the quality of transportation services that can be improved

This is my final project at Asia University Online Summer Program 2020, Artificial Intelligence Class
